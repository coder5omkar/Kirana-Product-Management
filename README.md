It was a very practical and good interview I have given time : **2 Feb 4.30 pm to 5.45pm IST**
where interviewer **Jay** focused much on actual **development skills, speed and efficiency and tested decision making** and choice selection of developer

(self note : it was good way to test developer instead of just syntax recognition and test brain cells for memorization capacity which will absolute soon in AI era)

challenges faced -> time limit of 1 hour, student grade laptop slow processing , mental fatigue after constant data bumbard (reading, searching) in vibe coding deepseek

Result -> in time 1 hour able to create backend then frontent but cross origin network configuration missed due to time limitations 
later I solved cross origin issue after bit exploration but time has already passed lol 

**The end to end working Backend and UI is uploaded in this rep for future reference and professional activity log.**

Here is a video demonstrating the project: [Watch the demo video on YouTube](https://youtu.be/4cF80Oj7hwI)
