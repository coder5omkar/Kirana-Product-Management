it was a very practical and good interview i have given
where interviewer Jay not focused much on syntax rather than 
actual work

challenges -> time 1 hour, student grade laptop, mental fatigue after constant data bumbard (reading, searching) in vibe coding

Result -> in time 1 hour able to create backend then frontment but cross origin network configuration missed in hurry
later solved after bit exploration but time has already passed lol
